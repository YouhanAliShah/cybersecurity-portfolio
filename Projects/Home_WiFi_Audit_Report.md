# Home Wi-Fi Security Audit  
**Date:** July 29, 2025  
**Done by:** Youhan Ali Shah  

## Scope  
I checked the security of my home Wi-Fi network to look for basic weaknesses.

## Findings  
- The Wi-Fi password is strong  
- The router uses WPA2 encryption  
- Default router login is still enabled (needs changing)

## Recommendations  
- Change the router admin password  
- Disable remote access  
- Update router firmware if available

## Conclusion  
The Wi-Fi is mostly secure, but a few steps like changing the admin password can improve protection.
